# encryptiionusinghybridrootmethodandneuralnetworksteganography
AN IMPROVED HYBRID NUMERICAL METHOD BASED ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM WITH NEURAL NETWORK STEGANOGRAPHY
To run the file
first execute encryption file with root finding methods-> python encryption.py
then for neural network steganography-> python NNStegano.py
then for decryption -> python decryption.py
