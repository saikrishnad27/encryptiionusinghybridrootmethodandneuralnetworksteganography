A cryptosystem is a set of algorithms, indexed by key(s), for encoding messages into cipher text and decoding them back into plaintext. The original information, which is to be protected by cryptography, is called plaintext. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into an unreadable form termed cipher text, or occasionally, a cryptogram. Decryption is the reverse process, recovering the plaintext back from a cipher text.
